## The repository

This is the repository which maintains my own exercises' answers and notes. The forders whose name prefixed *part* are the specific part's exercise.
And the folder *Notes* is storing notes I had written.

## The course

Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.
